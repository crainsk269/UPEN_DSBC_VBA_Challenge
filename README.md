# UPEN_DSBC_VBA_Challenge
I am an expert in Excel and VBA, and have been writing VBA code for roughly 10 years. With that being said, I had no difficulties authoring my own code. I reviewed the examples in the classwork to stick with what the class was taught because there are multiple ways of writing looping code and I have used various methods in the past. Regardless of how long someone has been writing any type of code, sometimes you just forget something. In this case, I forgot the number format to change a cell from general to percentage. I could have easily recorded a macro but instead I looked it up on Google and found my answer on StackOverflow.com. Additionally, I worked with six to eight of my fellow classmates over the weekend helping them out wherever they were having trouble and could not find an answer that made sense to them from any of their online searches.

I have uploaded three screenshots for the results in each spreadsheet (2018, 2019, and 2020). Also, it took me four screenshots to get all of the VBA code. I also copied the VBA code and pasted it in a text file and have included that with the rest of my submissions (it might be easier to read).

I believe I have covered everything per the VBA Challenge instructions. If anyone has any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

Thank you,

Samuel Crain
